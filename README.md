# ZeroReconstructed

A faithful C reconstruction of **Pump It Up: Zero** (International 7th Dance Floor), based on the
Linux arcade executable `piu` (ELF i386).

This project reverse-engineers the original binary and reproduces its gameplay, rendering, audio,
and state machine as closely as possible — no emulation, no wrappers. Native executable for
Windows and Linux, built with SDL2 + OpenGL.

It continues the series **PumpyReconstructed** (PREX 3) → **ExceedReconstructed** →
**Exceed2Reconstructed**. Screens from earlier versions that were replaced by their Zero
counterparts are kept in the tree, disabled (commented out or left out of the build).

## Song Select Controls

| Pad | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| DL / DR | Previous / next song (held: 300 → 200 → 100 → 50 ms repeat) |
| UL | Next available difficulty |
| UR | Next channel: BANYA → K-POP → POP → (ANOTHER, when open) → BANYA. REMIX is fixed when chosen in the Station |
| C | First press: READY. Second press: start |

## Modifiers (Commands)

Entered on the song select screen with the pads of the player they apply to (tables
`0x0811c3a0` / `0x0811c960` in `piu`).

| Sequence | Effect |
| -------- | ------ |
| `UL UR UL UR C` | Speed: 2X → 3X → 4X → 8X → RV → off |
| `UL UR UL UR UL UR UL UR C` | RV (random velocity) |
| `UL UR DL DR C` | Vanish → Non-Step → off |
| `UL UR UL UR DL DR DL DR C` | RS (random step) |
| `DL UR DL UR DR UL DR UL C` | X (global, both players) |
| `DR DL UR UL DR UR DL UL C` | EW (earthworm) |
| `UL DL UR DR DR UL UR DL C` | FD (freedom) |
| `DL DL DR DR UL UL UR UR C` | AC (acceleration) |
| `DR DR DL DL UR UR UL UL C` | DC (deceleration) |
| `DR DL UR UL DR DL UR UL C` | MR (mirror) |
| `DL UR C DL DR UL C DR C` | 1P × 2P (2 players) |
| `DL DR DL DR DL DR` | Reset |

Skin codes (`UL UR DL C DL DR DR UR x`) and grade reverse require unlocks stored in
`PIUZERO.INI`, which are not implemented yet.

## Debug Console Extras

| Command | Effect |
| ------- | ------ |
| `/skin N` | Use `BGA\SKIN0N.DAT` (0..7) from the next song on |
| F8 (during a song) | Autoplay on/off |

## Building (Windows and Linux)

Window, input and audio use **SDL2**, rendering is **OpenGL 1.1 + GLU**, and video uses
**libmpeg2** (the game's own `MPEG2.dll` is 32-bit and cannot be loaded by an x64 build).

**Windows** (Visual Studio 2019+ with [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io))

```powershell
vcpkg install sdl2:x64-windows zlib:x64-windows libmpeg2:x64-windows
cmake -S . -B build -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build build --target Pumpy --config Release
```

**Linux**

```bash
sudo apt install cmake build-essential libsdl2-dev libgl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev libmpeg2-4-dev
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
```

The CMake target is still named `Pumpy`. Place the executable in the Zero data folder,
next to `AUDIO/`, `BGA/`, `SCRIPT/`, `TITLE/`, `WAVE/` and `STEP.DAT`. Assets are **not**
included — you must provide your own copy of the Pump It Up Zero data files.

## Technical Notes

### Asset ciphers

- **ENC2** (`.AUD` = MP3, `.PNZ` = PNG): same scheme as Exceed 2, but the 4-byte seed of the key
  function (`0x80a3dc0`) is the MicroDog 3.4 "Convert" answer for the file's own 16-byte key
  (`0x80a6058`), so it changes per file. Answers come from the dongle table embedded in
  pumptools' `zerohook` (`tools/data/zero_dog.key`).
- **ENC1** (`D*.AUD` previews): 0x86-byte header, size = `u32@0x7E ^ 0xCCBB`, static 1 KB table
  at `0x8103940`, verified with Adler-32.
- **RESPAC2** (`.DAT`): index always at 0x28; global key also goes through the dongle.
- **MOV3** (`.MOV`): extra 16-byte key before the padding; MPEG-2 stream at `0xD0 + N`.

### Gameplay layout (SKIN00)

- Notes are `skinN.spr` (64×64, `TYPE ani`), positioned by code: column × 50 from x = 28 (P1)
  / 348 (P2), per-skin column offsets (`0x80806f0`). Step zone `01.spr` drawn at (32, 42).
- Long notes (`0x8087520`): body `skinN_l2` stretched as one quad, end `skinN_l3`, head
  `skinN_l1` on top; a held long note starts from the middle of the step zone.
- Judgment is per row (`0x808a760`): holding the pad hits long-note parts inside the PERFECT
  window; a row is judged once all its notes are hit; one MISS per row.

### Scoring and grade

- PERFECT +1000, GREAT +500 (each +1000 more with combo ≥ 4), GOOD +100, BAD −700, MISS −1000
- Grade: S ≥ 1.0 with no MISS, A ≥ 0.95, B ≥ 0.90, C ≥ 0.85, D ≥ 0.75, else F
